    "# VEERY DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT\n",
    "\n",
    "## Species description\n",
    "The Veery, Catharus fuscescens, is a small migratory songbird that \n",
    "belongs to the thrush family, Turdidae. These birds breed in the forests \n",
    "of North America, particularly in the eastern parts of the continent, \n",
    "and migrate to Central and South America for the winter. Veeries are \n",
    "known for their distinctive and melodious flute-like song, often heard \n",
    "in the early mornings and evenings during the breeding season. They have \n",
    "a reddish-brown back, creamy underparts with distinct spotting, and a \n",
    "white eyering. Veeries primarily feed on insects, spiders, and other \n",
    "invertebrates found in the leaf litter of forests, [ veery´s picture.](https://www.reddit.com/r/birding/comments/13g2iqj/veery_lifer_my_favorite_picture_so_far_this_year/#lightbox)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data description\n",
    "This species has an extemely large range of migration. Veeries breed \n",
    "humid deciduous forests and woodlands across southern Canada and the \n",
    "northern United States. They prefer to breed in dense growth and dense \n",
    "understory close to a water source, such as a stream. Veery's scientific \n",
    "name is Catharus fuscences. This bird of no more than 30 grams, according \n",
    "to studies these songbirds have been introduced to global weather cycles, \n",
    "allowing them to anticipate how dangerous a season will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study published in the journal Scientific Reports in 2018 showed that, \n",
    "over two decades, the migration patterns of these birds, also known as \n",
    "migratory veeries, from Delaware to South America accurately predicted\n",
    "the intensity of the Atlantic basin hurricane season. During bad years, \n",
    "the birds ended their breeding season earlier and headed to South \n",
    "America early, and during mild years, the birds stayed in eastern \n",
    "North America longer,[see information.](https://www.nationalgeographic.es/animales/2023/07/este-pajaro-es-capaz-de-predecir-como-de-intensa-sera-la-temporada-de-huracanes)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ecoregions where the Veery bird makes its migratory path have been \n",
    "searched. Ecoregions, in essence, represent the natural boundaries of \n",
    "the Earth and each area represents a land that contains distinct \n",
    "geography, vegetation, and natural communities that distinguish it from \n",
    "neighboring ecoregions. Ecoregions are shaped by biotic and abiotic \n",
    "conditions: geology, landforms, soils, vegetation, land use, wildlife, \n",
    "climate, and hydrology.\n",
    "\n",
    "These birds migrate to eastern South America; their winter range may\n",
    "include the entire Amazon basin, Mérida state in Venezuela, the \n",
    "headwaters of the Orinoco River, and São Paulo state, Brazil. \n",
    "Stopover regions during migration of several veeries from Delaware \n",
    "include the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, the coasts of the Carolinas, \n",
    "Cuba, Jamaica, Colombia, and Venezuela. They are very rare vagrants in\n",
    "Western Europe, [link of veery.](https://www.birdgenoscape.org/veery/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Veery conducted its information search using the GBIF \n",
    "(Global Biodiversity Information Facility) website. This international \n",
    "network and data infrastructure, funded by governments worldwide, aims \n",
    "to provide open access to data on all forms of life on Earth to anyone, \n",
    "regardless of their location. Information regarding the occurrence of \n",
    "this bird typically points to the summer months in the northern \n",
    "hemisphere, particularly in the United States and Canada, from April to \n",
    "September. Notably, the months of May, June, and July exhibit a higher \n",
    "frequency of occurrences, [see information.](https://www.gbif.org/) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods: Normalize the observations\n",
    "Normalization is a crucial process in data analysis that helps mitigate \n",
    "biases caused by differences in sampling effort, area coverage, or other \n",
    "factors that could skew the results. In this context, normalization was \n",
    "essential to ensure a fair comparison of data on the occurrence of the \n",
    "Veery across different ecoregions, months, and areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "To normalize the data by sampling effort in the ecoregion and month, \n",
    "and by area, a specific methodology was employed. The process likely involved\n",
    "adjusting the raw occurrence data based on the level of effort invested \n",
    "in collecting the data within each ecoregion and month. By accounting for \n",
    "variations in sampling intensity, researchers could more accurately assess \n",
    "the true distribution and abundance of Veery sightings across different \n",
    "regions and time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, normalizing by area would involve accounting for the size \n",
    "of the areas over which the observations were made. This adjustment helps \n",
    "in comparing the density or frequency of occurrences across regions of varying \n",
    "sizes, ensuring that the analysis is not skewed simply by the spatial extent \n",
    "of the observation areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the normalization process in this study likely involved complex \n",
    "statistical techniques to standardize the data, enabling more meaningful \n",
    "comparisons and interpretations of Veery occurrence patterns across different \n",
    "ecological regions and time frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following map you can see the distribution of the Veery bird \n",
    "in its migration trajectory during the months of the year.\n",

    "## Discussion and Conclusion\n",
    "The migration of the Veery, a neotropical migrant bird, presents a \n",
    "fascinating ecological phenomenon. Understanding the timing, routes, and\n",
    "stopover sites of its migration is crucial for conservation efforts and \n",
    "illuminating the interconnectedness of ecosystems across continents. \n",
    "Further research on the Veery's migration patterns could unveil intricate \n",
    "adaptations to environmental changes and aid in the preservation of its \n",
    "migratory routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the Veery's migration is a significant phenomenon, with \n",
    "the summer months marking its most critical period. These months \n",
    "represent the peak of migratory activity for this species, as they travel \n",
    "long distances from their breeding grounds to their wintering areas. \n",
    "Understanding and protecting this crucial phase of their life cycle is \n",
    "vital to ensure the species' preservation and the balance of the \n",
    "ecosystems they inhabit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the Veery's sensitivity to hurricanes adds an additional layer \n",
    "of challenges to its migration. These extreme weather events can drastically \n",
    "alter their migratory routes and affect their ability to find shelter and \n",
    "food along the way. Continued research on how hurricanes impact the Veery \n",
    "is essential to develop effective conservation strategies that mitigate \n",
    "these risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conserving this migratory species is not only important locally but also \n",
    "internationally, as the Veery crosses multiple borders during its \n",
    "migratory journey. Collaboration between countries in protecting critical \n",
    "areas for the Veery is essential to ensure its long-term survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, continuous monitoring of Veery populations and \n",
    "identification of key areas for their migration are crucial for \n",
    "implementing effective conservation measures. Protecting critical habitats \n",
    "along their migratory route and addressing the threats they face during \n",
    "this crucial period are essential steps to ensure the long-term viability \n",
    "of this sensitive and emblematic species.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth acknowledging the significant effort made by the GBIF in \n",
    "showcasing Veery information. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility \n",
    "plays a crucial role in providing open access to data on species like the \n",
    "Veery, facilitating research, conservation efforts, and a better \n",
    "understanding of migratory patterns and challenges faced by such species.\n",
